## Welcome to the International Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification

The Subcommission represents a core business for the [International Commission on Stratigraphy](https://stratigraphy.org/) the primary body for creating, discussing, publishing and disseminating an internationally agreed-upon guide on stratigraphic terminology and classification or-in other words standardization of the Stratigraphic Units.

Its **first priority is to advertise new developments in stratigraphic methods, check that the procedures are carefully followed, and monitor the application of the accepted rules**. They fall in two categories:

1. **the world-wide acceptance of the basic rules of stratigraphy**, without which no time-scale is meaningful, because of the potential gap between knowledge and concepts;
2. **coordination of international application of stratigraphic principles and concepts**, with special reference to the most important “users” of stratigraphy, as Geological Surveys, graduate and undergraduate teaching, oil companies, professionals.


**The objectives of the Subcommission** are relevant to IUGS policy because standardization of the stratigraphic terminology is essential to any attempt of global correlation, and requires a large and active international cooperation.
